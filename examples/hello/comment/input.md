Any program requires comments and indeed Rust supports
a few different varieties:

* *Regular comments* which are ignored by the compiler:
 - `// Line comments which go to the end of the line.`
 - `/* Block comments which go to the closing delimiter. */`
* *Doc comments* which are parsed into HTML library
[documentation][docs]:
 - `/// Generate library docs for the following item.`
 - `//! Generate library docs for the enclosing item.`

{comment.play}
