A bound can also be expressed using a `where` clause immediately
before the opening `{`, rather than at the type's first mention. 
Additionally, `where` clauses can apply bounds to arbitrary types, 
rather than just to type parameters.

Some cases that a `where` clause is useful:

* When specifying generic types and bounds separately is clearer:

```rust
impl <A: TraitB + TraitC, D: TraitE + TraitF> MyTrait<A, D> for YourType {}

// Expressing bounds with a `where` clause
impl <A, D> MyTrait<A, D> for YourType where
    A: TraitB + TraitC,
    D: TraitE + TraitF {}
```

* When using a `where` clause is more expressive than using normal syntax. 
The `impl` in this example cannot be directly expressed without a `where` clause:

{where.play}
