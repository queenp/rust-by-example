A `trait` that is generic over its container type has type specification
requirements - users of the `trait` *must* specify all of its generic types.

In the example below, the `Contains` `trait` allows the use of the generic 
types `A` and `B`. The trait is then implemented for the `Container` type, 
specifying `i32` for `A` and `B` so that it can be used with `fn difference()`.

Because `Contains` is generic, we are forced to explicitly state *all* of the 
generic types for `fn difference()`. In practice, we want a way to express that 
`A` and `B` are determined by the *input* `C`. As you will see in the next 
section, associated types provide exactly that capability.
